Hello!

Flowstate is an interface to connect lab professionals, pharmacists, and physicians.

I had the unique privilege of implementing a LIMS for a new COVID qPCR lab from the perspective of a lab technician. The system we built was great for reporting bulk clinical results, but not for workflow tracking, inventory management, or ease of use.
Before that, I worked as a pharmacy technician and found their system great for ease of use, Rx tracking and inventory management, but not for physician/patient outreach.
So why not combine the two?

This is by no means compliant to any regulatory agency.
Also, I haven't even started thinking about how to incorporate insurance into all this.

The foundation of this app is from Nick Janetakis' "Build a SaaS App with Flask" course.

I'm still a Python/Flask beginner, so I'll be using his code and structure as training wheels at first.
